# g(v_min) distributions
first row contains the values of v_min below which are $n$ rows of g(v_min) for each day of the year starting Jan1 and ending Dec 1/ - (1 year)/n. Each file has a version with '_GF' which is identical to the version without that label but accounts for the effect of gravitational focusing. The files correspond to each component of the halo model:

## gvmin_Halo.txt
Is the g(v_min) of the isotropic halo with v_0 = 238 km/s and v_esc = 528 km/s

## gvmin_Saus.txt
Is the g(v_min) of Sausage with beta = 0.9, v_0 = 238 km/s and v_esc = 528 km/s

## gvmin_S1.txt and gvmin_S2.txt
Is the summed g(v_min) of the Shards which contains S1 and S2 streams
